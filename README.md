# Broadcasting and DoS Mitigation

## Overview

This project was developed as part of a hands-on lab for Introduction to Cryptography and Computer Security - Fall 2024. It demonstrates:
- Client-server communication using UDP.
- Broadcasting messages from the client to the server.
- Implementation of DoS (Denial of Service) mitigation strategies.

This lab provided an opportunity to apply networking principles in a practical setting, showcasing skills in socket programming, multithreading, and DoS mitigation techniques.

## Features

- Broadcast messages to a server using UDP.
- Server responds to clients with message acknowledgments.
- Anti-DoS strategies:
  - Rate-limiting requests per client.
  - Blacklisting of abusive clients.
  - Multithreaded request handling for scalability.
