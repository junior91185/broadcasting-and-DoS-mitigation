# Broadcasting and DoS Mitigation

## Overview

This project was developed as part of a hands-on lab for *Introduction to Cryptography and Computer Security. It demonstrates:
- Client-server communication using UDP.
- Broadcasting messages from the client to the server.
- Implementation of DoS (Denial of Service) mitigation strategies.

This lab provided an opportunity to apply networking principles in a practical setting, showcasing skills in socket programming, multithreading, and DoS mitigation techniques.

## Features

- **Client-Server Communication**:
    - Clients broadcast UDP messages to the server
    - The server listens for broadcasts and responds dynamically to clients
- **Anti-DoS Strategies**:
  - Rate-limiting requests per client
  - Blacklisting abusive clients
  - Multithreaded request handling for scalability

## Screenshots and Results

### 1. Broadcasting in Action
The client broadcasts messages to the server, which listens and responds in real-time

Here, the server is listening for broadcasts

Here are the results of a successful client broadcast

### 2. DoS Mitigation in Action
Here, the server safeguards itself against excessive traffic by implementing rate limiting and blacklisting

### 3. Broadcasting Loop in Action
Hereâ€™s the output from a client broadcasting continuously to the server
